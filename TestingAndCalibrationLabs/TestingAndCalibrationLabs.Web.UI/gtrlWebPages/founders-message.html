	  <p >
The toughest challenge, which we have faced, while transition from an employee to an entrepreneur 
was not- what to do? ; But, what not to do? But, while groping for the answer, we have realized that a
 man can do anything but not everything, and each trip-up has given us renewed commitment and made us
  stronger as an organization. We seek out challenges and recognize opportunity in those challenges. We 
  as an organization always keeps ourself abreast with new scientific developments and try to bridge the 
  gap between scientific advancement and its real application in the market. 
We believe that it is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness.</p>

<p>At the inception of the company it was like all the three cofounders were boarding 3 different boats. 
Mr. Ranjan was more or less believer in making a profitable organization, means were secondary; Mr. Sharan 
use to have a balanced approach towards the business and ethics; whereas, my proposals use to have a tinge of
 utopian characteristics. Most probably the origin of these differences can be traced in our past work experience! 
  But, everybody has started to understand in due course of time the importance of each-other's values, and a common 
  set of values has bubbled up, which according to everybody was best to achieve the mission of the organization.
   Any individual needs honesty, hard labor, and discipline to succeed in any wake of life but, we believe, to make
    GTRL a successful organization our people should espouse our company values of 
<font color="teal"><b><i>"A Triple I- Accountability, Integrity, Innovation, & Involvement."</i></b></font> </p>

<p>
GTRL's first 5 year plan is to target mainly service based projects and to make its state level laboratory into
 a regional level by the end of the first 3 years and in next 2 years to national level. We understand that it's a
  daunting task to achieve this in a short span of 5 years but the dedication, commitment,
 experience and competence of our team will make sure the success of this task. 
</p> 

<p>As a small startup company led by young budding entrepreneurs, we are often asked two tough questions- First one, where we see our company after a decade? And second, why we are so optimistic in this bad economy about success of our project? We find it relatively easy to answer the first one that we have envisioned to take our laboratory to the level of international standard with full fledged R&D capabilities. But, second one is a bit difficult to answer. However, we drew our inspiration from the quote of Theodore Roosevelt, "It is hard to fail, but it is worse never to have tried to succeed," and we endorse his saying, "It is only through labor and painful effort, by grim energy and resolute courage, that we move on to better things." We or any other savvy investor would believe that it would be the best time to invest in companies with good fundaments when its share value is down, and we think that science is a good investment for long term because no economy can afford to neglect it for a long. But, two major challenges that we see in our path is lack of enough trained human resources and funding. Government has taken many steps, which create optimism that the problem of trained human resource will be solved in next few years, and in addition to that GTRL and many science based companies like us are determined to promote the science education in India, however issue of funding will remain a matter of concern for the project with long incubation period, but we expect that companies with strong science and business foundation will remain alluring investment target for long term investors. </p>

<p>To conclude, GTRL has been started as a science based company and its prime focus will remain that. In spite of the fact that progress of the science is painfully slow, our prime motive will remain catalyzing the application of science for the service of society on the account of-</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><font color="teal">All our science, measured against reality, is primitive and<br />
childlike - and yet it is the most precious thing we have.<br />
